A few guideline
Here are a few guidelines to help you name your elements structurally, and these are just that guidelines. In the end, you have to use what's best for you and 
the project at hand.!

1. When assigning a class or id, ask yourself "What is this element for?"
Good: .ad-banner, .banner
Bad: .sidebar-images

2. Avoid using names that rely on locational or visual aspects of the particular element.

3. Use names that are intuitive to you
